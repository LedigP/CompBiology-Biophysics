# CompBiology-Biophysics
It's an general repository containing multiple script for several task into computational biophysics or biology, which should be update frequently for me.
If you've any questions, please write me to groponp@gmail.com. Programming lenguage used into this repo are: C++, Fortran95, Tcl, Python, Bash, AWK. 

If you're using any code, please cite our papers:
